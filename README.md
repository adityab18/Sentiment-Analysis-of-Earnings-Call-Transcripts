# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Earnings-Call-Transcripts
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on earnings call transcripts using the Loughran-McDonald (LM) dictionary, which is tailored for financial text. By analysing the sentiment expressed during these calls, the project aims to uncover trends and insights related to company performance and market perception. The analysis involves collecting and preprocessing transcripts, scoring sentiment based on positive, negative, and uncertain word categories, and visualising trends over time and across sectors. The goal is to correlate sentiment scores with financial metrics to derive actionable insights for investors and analysts.
